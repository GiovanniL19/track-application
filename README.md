# Track-application
A Train management application for mobile with a stunning user interface and smart features such as predictions and recommendations

##Background

The idea for Track appeared when a minor issue was raised during the process of purchasing train tickets on mobile devices. When looking for train information or booking regular tickets, users have no choice but to fill in all the required information via the keyboard every time. It is believed that the process of viewing and booking trains on your devices can be simplified with the following; a recommendation engine for future travel and live relevant app notifications with reliable arrival, departure and disruption information live from National Rail. The idea is to minimise user input as much as possible to save time for the user. The application will have an algorithm that will study habits of the user’s interaction and generate real time notifications and recommendations from this data. The more users interact with the application, the better the recommendations are. All data will be stored on “the cloud” so the user can access this information anywhere with an internet connect on any device including computers.

##Aims

The aim of this project is as follows; to build a well-engineered, reliable, cloud based train booking/management solution which studies user behaviours and provides detailed recommendations and notifications on train information. The application will implement the following:

A departure and arrival board with live train information
-The ability for users to view a route to and from a destination via their input and recommendations
-The ability to select popular stations and routes
-User accounts
-The option for users to star routes for future reference
-An enjoyable and interactive design
-Communication to the web service which communicates to National Rail and the database
